The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data
centers. What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud?

A: Nowadays the amount of data generated is much more beyond the scope of personal
computers' memories. By offering a DBMS as a cloud service, Microsoft provides all its
users the opportunity to analyze large datasets, or do some data science relevant work.



What do you consider the benefits or drawbacks to this approach compared to running the
database locally?

A: Benefits: It offers fast speed in analyzing datasets, and it's convenient to open
and save queries, and export the data generated.

Drawbacks: Users may suffer from data loss and service attacks. And the performance of cloud computing
seems to be highly dependent on internet connection, and cloud services may sometimes experience
outage and downtime. Besides, users of Microsoft Azure services have to spend a considerable amount of money
comparing to running the database locally free of charge.
