Part (a) R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A.

Since D → B, we have D+ = {D,B}, so we break R into R1(B,D), R2(A,C,D,E), R1 is in BCNF.
Since CE → A, {C,E}+ = {A,C,E}, we break R2 into R3(A,C,E) and R4(C,D,E).
Then all three tables are in BCNF since for all non-trivial dependency X → Y, X is a superkey.
Thus the decomposition gives us R1(B,D), R3(A,C,E), and R4(C,D,E).




Part (b) S(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B.

Since A → E, we have A+ = {A,E}, so we break S into S1(A,E), S2(A,B,C,D), S1 is in BCNF.
since BC → A, {B,C}+ = {A,B,C}, we break S2 into S3(A,B,C) and S4(B,C,D).
We can then check to confirm that S3 and S4 are both in BCNF since for all possible
combination of attributes, its closure is either trivial or all attributes in the table.
Thus the decomposition gives us S1(A,E), S3(A,B,C), and S4(B,C,D).






A set of attributes X is called closed (with respect to a given set of functional dependencies) if
X⁺ = X. Consider a relation with schema R(A,B,C,D) and an unknown set of functional
dependencies. For each closed attribute set below, give a set of functional dependencies that is
consistent with it.


Part (c) All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.

Since all subsets are closed, we can simply derive that trivial functional dependencies
A → A
B → B
C → C
D → D
being consistent functional dependencies.




Part (d) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.

The functional dependencies that the closure of every single attribute being
all attributes, i.e.,
A → B
B → C
C → D
D → A
satisfy the given subsets {} and {A,B,C,D} as closed.





Part (e) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.

Since the closure of B is not B, but the closure of BC is BC, we have B → C and C → B.
Let the closure of A and D be all attributes and we have the functional dependencies
A → B,C,D
B → C
C → B
D → A,B,C
